This is&nbsp;less about legal requirements and more about what it is to be a good employer,1&nbsp;and HR should be at the heart of thinking about how working practices mature.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EI see virtual reality as a massive opportunity for recruitment and learning and development professionals, given its ability to create truly immersive experiences in a safe environment and&nbsp;its&nbsp;increasingly accessible pricing. I can envision nimbler organizations making use of the cheaper platforms (Daydream, Cardboard, etc.) to think about learning experiences in a very different way.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EFor recruiters,&nbsp;VR will enable attraction campaigns to incorporate a realistic snapshot of the office environment for candidates to evaluate and even to support the onboarding process, supporting efforts to provide a transparent view of the workplace. We will see increasing automation, hopefully strategically employed to augment our capabilities and free up resources rather than for opportunist&nbsp;cost saving.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Ch2\u003E2.New Ways of Working\u003C/h2\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EWe will continue to see the evolution of the law and debate around zero-hour contracts, the gig economy and the changing nature of employment. This will continue through 2017 and beyond as organizations continue to vary their organizational structures to find ways to be more competitive.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EWe will see some organizations in this space recognizing that investing in people is a way to be more competitive. Employee wellbeing needs to be at the heart of their strategy — with the cost of not doing this being crippling in terms of both time and goodwill.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Ch2\u003E3.Development of Ethical Workplaces\u003C/h2\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EThe last 12 months have put people’s beliefs and desire to be heard at the forefront of public consciousness. HR practitioners will be expected to lead and set the standards of what is acceptable in terms of conflict and debate in the workplace, while at the same time reflecting hard on their own values and principles and how they manifest in their work.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EInequality, access to education, social mobility, democracy, voice, immigration and the ethics of technology are all issues that will bridge our personal and professional lives. It will be complex and at times difficult, but it also places HR where it should be: at the heart of ensuring inclusive and productive workplaces, championing better work and working lives.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Ch3\u003EChris Russell\u003C/h3\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EChris Russell is considered the ‘mad scientist of online recruiting’ by his peers.

Acceleration of&nbsp;HR Technologies\u003C/h2\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EThere has never been more HR technology than exists today. That trend will only accelerate in 2017 as more software developers and vendors try to put structure around recruiting and HR processes. What I fear is that many of them will simply create technology that doesn’t solve practical problems. Too often I see new products come out that don’t take into account the actual workflow of a recruiter or human resource professional.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EProducts need to involve actual practitioners to be effective. For instance, we have good examples of interview management tools that evolved from an actual problem in the recruiting process that wasn’t being well served by ATS vendors.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003ETechnology like AI sounds cool, but folks in HR and recruiting are not techies. They need products that are simple, easy to use, and most importantly save them time! Time savings is probably the best feature any vendor can build into its product. If it doesn’t make the recruiter’s job easier, think twice about adding it.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Ch3\u003EJeff Wellstead\u003C/h3\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJeff is a Partner – Digital People Practice at&nbsp;\u003C/em\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://digitalworksgroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDigital Works Group\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cem\u003E.

          “Kristina is brilliant — she is hands down the most creative and skilled designer I&#39;ve ever worked with. Her superpower is her ability to create flawless experiences across product

She combines an excellent suite of core skills with expertise in future visioning, strategic thinking, and a broad cultural and technological understanding. She&#39;s bright, diligent, and hard-working and has great knowledge in UX, which is to her credit.

During my time working with Kristina, I has been witnessing her successful management of creative practice leading to cutting-edge concepts for the next generation of the project. She holds a clear vision for the role design can play to improve any and all experiences. Her ability to dive into both product design and visual design is incredible, making her a very flexible and holistic designer.”

          “I was working with Kristina at Altoros, where she managed me directly as a Chief Marketing Officer while I was the leader of the team working on digital campaigns for cloud-native, AI and blockchain development company business lines.

Kristina is a positive and pleasant to work with manager, she has a comprehensive knowledge in marketing and digital strategies, she’s always full of ideas and her communication skills are excellent. Also she’s quite detail oriented, she always meets her deadlines and has a rare high value ability to make those long-lasting mutually beneficial relationships.”

          “Working with Kristina during her workshop for APRO Software was a real pleasure. Her being prepared for the workshop was trully splendid. She presented successful and compelling Case Studies from her work experience which in the end gave us a hand in coming up with a marketing strategy and a solid plan of action for the nearest 6 months.
 
Kristina came across as a superb speaker capable of capturing the audience. All the information was well-structured and really easy to follow.
 
I highly recommend Kristina&#39;s workshop for anyone who wants to pump their marketing strategy.

Thank you and hope for further cooperation. ”
